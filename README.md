======================

An application to search for **Yle Areena** programs on the fly!

----------

Greetings!
---------------

YleFunFun is an application made with Unity using [**Yle API**][1] to search for programs on [**Yle Areena**][2]

> **Note:**

> - This is an *non-profit* and *non-commercial* project since the main purpose is for practicing with Unity. Therefore, the code is open for use which you can fork and modify to fit your needs. 
> - Although it has already been a pair of **AppId** and **AppKey** in the application, you, however, should ask them for yourself on **Yle API website**. There will be also a secret key if you need more advanced usage.
> - Remember to spend some time to read [**Yle API license**][3].
> - Enjoy !!! :smiley:
